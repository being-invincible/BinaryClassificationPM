# BinaryClassificationPM

This paper focuses on applying various Machine Learning and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approaches, to determine the binary classification of the failures on the machines which is very crucial in enhancing the reduction of downtime in industries. This paper implements and compares three classification techniques: Logistic Regression, Gradient Tree Classifier, and Random Forest. During the pre-processing stage, automatic outlier detection and over-sampling analysis are performed, and the results are compared in the interest of assessing the best performance of the model. Among the used evaluation measures, the Random Forest model has the highest average accuracy of 99% after hyperparameter tuning using the grid search method. The measure of precision and recall are perfectly balanced with the highest F1 score of 99.33%. Moreover, adopting the Explainable AI tools like SHAP and LIME, improved the model interpretability to explain how the black box models predict the machine failures by providing the global and local explanations.
